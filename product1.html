        This beautiful black Patan Patola silk double Ikat Nari Kunjar bhat saree has motifs of kunjar (elephants), 
        tota (parrots), phul (flowers) in bright colours, woven with precision and patience. This masterpiece has been 
        woven by weavers over months of painstaking labour. This six yard collector's item has self Ikat stripes border
         and two-way pallu with floral Ikat motifs. The labour and significant hard work that has gone into its creation, 
         makes this saree, which does not have a blouse with it, a prestigious, aristocratic, desirable possession. </p>
